# PersonalityTest

Contributors: Anna Haller, Jay Melton, Dorris Tazi

Objective: We plan to create a personality test that determines a user's placement on the moral alignment chart.

The project will contain at least 3 classes: the Question class, the Quiz class, and the User class.

Question class - Jay Melton

Description: The Question class creates and produces questions for the Quiz. It stores them in a string and an array for the possible answers. 
I am not sure if we will do fully multiple choice or allow for open-ended, so I included constructors for both for now. Can also get/set the text for questions
and their potential answers. Stores the questions in an array so they can be accessed by other classes in the package.

Quiz class - dorris

User class - Anna Haller
